# Cloud Resume Challenge Project

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the Cloud Resume Challenge, showcasing a static website resume hosted on AWS with various cloud services integrated. The resume is built with HTML and CSS, and includes a visitor counter implemented with JavaScript and AWS services.

## What's in the Project

1. **Static Website**
   - HTML file (`index.html`) containing the resume content
   - CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling the resume
   - JavaScript file (`script.js`) for implementing the visitor counter

2. **AWS Services Used**
   - S3: Hosts the static website files
   - CloudFront: Provides HTTPS and caching
   - Lambda: Runs the backend logic for the visitor counter
   - API Gateway: Creates a RESTful API for the visitor counter
   - DynamoDB: Stores the visitor count

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automating deployments to S3



## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in cloud computing and web development:

1. **Cloud Services**: I learned the basics of cloud computing and how to use various AWS services like S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

2. **Static Website Hosting**: I learned how to host a static website on Amazon S3 and serve it securely using CloudFront.

3. **Serverless Computing**: I gained experience with serverless architecture by implementing a Lambda function for the visitor counter.

4. **Database Management**: I learned how to use DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service, to store and retrieve data.

5. **API Development**: I learned how to create and use a RESTful API with API Gateway to connect my frontend to the Lambda function.

6. **CI/CD Practices**: I implemented a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, learning about automated deployment processes.

7. **Frontend Development**: I improved my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building a responsive resume website.

8. **Version Control**: I gained more experience with Git and GitHub for managing my project's source code.

9. **Security Best Practices**: I learned about securing cloud applications, including using HTTPS and managing AWS credentials securely.

10. **Cloud Cost Management**: I gained awareness of how to use cloud services cost-effectively, utilizing AWS's free tier where possible.

This project provided hands-on experience with cloud technologies and modern web development practices, serving as an excellent introduction to cloud computing and its real-world applications.
